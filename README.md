# Semi-Supervised-Time-Series-Classification-by-Temporal-Relation-Prediction
## Project Description
This work is based on the following paper. I tried to implement the SemiTime model from scratch to demonstrate the effectiveness of the self-supervised dataset in training the supervised classification model.
In the Jupyter Notebook you can find the implementation of two different models and their trainer. In particular, the semi-supervised trainer follows the SemiTime Mini-batch training algorithm, which can be found on page 3 of the mentioned document.
