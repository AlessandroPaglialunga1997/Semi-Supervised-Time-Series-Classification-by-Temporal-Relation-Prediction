# Semi-Supervised-Time-Series-Classification-by-Temporal-Relation-Prediction
## Project Description
This work is based on the following paper. I attempted to implement the SemiTime Model from scratch to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Self-Supervised Dataset during Supervised Classification Model training.
In the Jupyter Notebook, one can find the implementation of two different models and their trainer. In particular, Semi-Supervised Trainer follows the SemiTime Mini-batch Training algorithm 
## Run Model Training and Evaluation
## Check Results
